## Description

Global/Local mean field power (GMFP/LMFP) is often used to measure the global excitability in studies of non-invasive neuromodulation treatments (such as TMS). This document shows how GMFP/LMFP was computed on a given EEG epoch.

The formula of how to calculate GMFP/LMFP is listed as below:

where $t$ is time; $K$ is the number of included EEG channels; $V_{i}$ is the voltage in channel $i$; $V_{mean}$ is the mean of the voltages in all channels.
